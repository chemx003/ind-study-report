\section{Introduction}
Heterogeneous materials appear in all kinds of forms and can be found naturally 
and in industrial applications. Recently, interest has grown in artificially
constructed phononic media which can alter the propagation of acoustic and
elastic waves. A phononic medium is a heterogeneous material which possesses
spatial periodicity in the arrangement of its constituents, its microstructure,
or its boundary conditions. As a result of this periodic structure, it has been 
shown that there exists band gaps for which certain frequencies of waves cannot 
propagate.

\subsection{Phononic media}
As mentioned before, the field of phononic media has grown tremendously in the 
past two decades and continues to grow today. The existence of band gaps in 
these materials has resulted in many practical applications in subwavelength 
imaging, vibration, control and even acoustic cloaking.

\subsection{Mechanisms for band gap formation}
The formation of band gaps and effect of dispersion on waves is material 
dependent, but the underlying physics is the same. The two mechanisms are
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{Bragg scattering}: At certain frequencies, a wave interacts 
	with the structure of the material in a way that causes deconstructive 
	interference. Here the behavior is dependent on the periodicity of the 
	material \cite{laude15}.
	\item \emph{Local resonance}: When resonators are placed inside of a 
	materials, interactions occur around the resonating frequency of the 
	included resonators. At these frequencies, the resonators begin to absorb 
	energy from incident waves and thus affect the propagation of the waves.
\end{enumerate}
To see the effect of these phenomena on the dispersion relation itself, we 
refer to Figure \ref{fig:bslr} from Laude's book.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{bandgaps.png}
	\caption{Given the resonant frequency of inclusions and the periodicity of 
	the material we can get an idea of where the band gaps will form. Figure 
	from \cite{laude15}}
	\label{fig:bslr}
\end{figure}
When resonators are included we can predict that a band gap will form around 
the resonant frequency. This band gap is in addition to the band gap caused by 
Bragg scattering, and occasionally the two band gaps can overlap to form a 
larger one.

\subsection{Floquet-Bloch theorem} \label{fbt}
Given the equation
\begin{equation} \label{floqueteqn}
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + c(x)y = 0
\end{equation}
where \underline{c(x) is periodic in} $x$, Floquet's theorem says that 
(\ref{floqueteqn}) has two solutions
\begin{align*}
u(x) &= \tilde{u}_1(x)e^{ikx} \\
&= \tilde{u}_2(x)e^{-ikx}
\end{align*}
In the above, $\tilde{f}_1$ and $\tilde{f}_2$ are also periodic in $x$ 
\cite{magnus79}.

Bloch's theorem is similar to Floquet's theorem but applies to higher 
dimensions \cite{laude15}. 

Given
\begin{equation} \label{blocheqn}
-\nabla \cdot \left( c(\mathbf{r}) \nabla u(\mathbf{r}) \right) = \omega^2 
u(\mathbf{r})
\end{equation}
where \underline{$c(\mathbf{r})$ is periodic in space}, Bloch's theorem says 
equation (\ref{blocheqn}) has eigensolutions
\begin{equation}
u(\mathbf{r}) = \tilde{u}(\mathbf{r}) e^{-i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} 
\end{equation}
These eigensolutions are called \emph{Bloch waves} and equation 
(\ref{blocheqn}) is called the periodic Helmholtz equation.

\section{Current research in the field}
\subsection{Damping}
In applications, energy is often lost through damping. This will affect the 
propagation of waves, and thus models that consider this effect will better 
represent the actual behavior of a material. Within the body of research on 
damping, studies focus on either harmonic wave propagation or free wave 
propagation. A study of harmonic wave propagation entails one in which the wave 
numbers are confined to be real while free wave propagation allows for complex 
wave numbers (and as a result evanescent waves). Standard computational methods 
as discussed in Section \ref{methods} are used in both types of studies. 

In \cite{hussein14}, dispersion relations are first obtained for a 1D diatomic 
lattice with linear viscous damping. The method of analysis for this example is 
then extended to a 1D lattice with internal resonators and also a 2D phononic 
crystal with square unit cells embedded with a single, denser square inclusion. 
The general result of including damping is the collapase of the band gap 
between the optical and acoustic branches of the dispersion relation. This 
occurs such that the optical branch lowers proportional to the amount of 
damping.

\subsection{Nonlinear systems}
Relative to linear studies, there have been fewer studies of nonlinear phononic 
materials. Due to nonlinearities, Bloch's theorem cannot not be applied in the 
same way to obtain an eigenvalue problem for the dispersion relation -at least 
not immediately. Perturbation techniques have been developed as early as 1994 
in order to study weakly non-linear systems. These techniques ``expand" the 
governing equations and produce a linear equation while instead considering the 
nonlinearities to be a part of forcing term.

\subsection{Disordered materials}
Just as sparse as nonlinear systems, the study of phononic media with disorder 
has not been widely researched. Incorporating even small amounts of disorder 
can increase the predictablility of a model much like damping. In the 
manufacturing process perfect periodicity may not be able to be acheived. The 
difficulty in disordered phononic media is that the conventional method of 
Bloch wave analysis does not work. A requirement of Floquet-Bloch theory is 
that the material properties vary periodically with a known period. A single 
unit cell can no longer model the behavior of the entire system if there is 
even mild disorder.

Recently, there has been research done on so called hyperuniform phononic 
crystals. Hyperuniformity is a way of categorizing point distributions. It 
specifically refers to distributions with the fluctuations in density completly 
vanish as the window of observation increases. Despite not having any 
periodicity, and therefore no Bragg peaks, there still exists band gaps.

An earlier paper in 2010 by, examined a 2d phononic medium with circular 
inclusions arranged in a lattice. Disorder was added to the system by 
increasing or decreasing the size of the inclusions or displacing them by some 
small amount. Here they used the plane-wave expansion method. Of course, due to 
the added disorder they were no longer able to look at a single unit cell and 
instead define a `supercell' for which the analysis was carried out. 

\subsection{Dynamic effective properties}
With any heterogeneous material, it is of interest to be able to define 
effective properties and model the material as one homogenous material. This 
reduces the computational cost of modeling. Most analysis in homogenization has 
been done in the long wavelength limit. Trying to perform a similar type of 
analysis on a material with dispersive properties results in the loss of this 
behavior. The problem here lies in the volume averages used to calculate the 
effective properties. The richness in behavior of these phononic media is due 
to the relative motion of contituents as such the behavior is said to be 
nonlocal and this must be taken into affect when trying to formulate dynamic 
effective properties.

Michael Frazier has done some work calculating the dynamic effective viscosity 
in damped 1D layered structures.

\section{Dispersion relations}
Dispersion relations provide all of the information necessary to characterize 
the behavior of waves propagating in a phononic medium. Mathematically, they 
are a relationship between the frequency of a wave and its wavenumber. From 
this relationship, it is possible to determine the phase velocity and group 
velocity. Dispersion relationships immediately indicate where the frequency 
band gaps of a system are. For this reason, they are also called frequency band 
diagrams or frequency band structures.

As will be shown, there are a variety of waves to calculate dispersion 
relations, however, there is a commonality between each type of analysis. This 
common feature is the application of Floquet-Bloch theory.

\subsection{Transfer matrix method}
The transfer matrix method enforces continuity between layers of a system. At 
the interface between two unit cells the displacements must be equal and the 
forces or tractions must be as well. First, a relationship between these 
variables must be derived from one end of the unit cell to the other end. This 
results in the formulation of a so called transfer matrix. This type of 
analysis is completed by of course applying Bloch's theorem to relate the 
displacements and forces in one cell to another.

\subsection{Scalar wave equation}
The scalar wave equation is 
\begin{equation} \label{swe}
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation}
where $u$ is the displacement and $c$ is the wave speed. Assume a solution of 
the form
\begin{equation}
u(x,t) = A\sin(kx - \omega t)
\end{equation}
In fact, we can assume $u(x,t) = f(kx-\omega t)$ and the following results will 
still hold. $k$ is the wave number which describes the ``spatial" frequency of 
the wave for a fixed time and $\omega$ is the angular frequency that describes 
the temporal frequency of the wave. Substituting this solution into the wave 
equation gives
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = c^2 k^2
\end{equation}
Taking the square root of the above
\begin{equation} \label{nd}
\omega = \pm c k
\end{equation}
This equation gives a relationship between the frequency of the wave and its 
wave number. We call relations of this type dispersion relations. In general, 
dispersion relations can be written in the form
\begin{equation} \label{wk}
\omega = \omega(k)
\end{equation}
To get a flavor for what dispersion entails, we need to look at the phase 
velocities waves. The phase velocity of a wave is
\begin{equation}
v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}
\end{equation}
Thus, for the scalar wave equation discussed in this introductory paragraph
\begin{equation}
v_p = c
\end{equation}
This relation holds for all waves admissible according to (\ref{swe}). Here, 
every wave propagates at the same velocity regardless of frequency. In this 
case, we say that there is \underline{no} dispersion. In systems with 
dispersion we expect a relation in the form (\ref{wk}) and also
\begin{equation}
v_p = v_p(\omega) = v_p(\omega(k))
\end{equation}

\subsection{Monatomic lattice} \label{monatomic}
Take a system of $n$ masses and springs like in Figure \ref{fig:ms} 
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{mass-spring.pdf}
	\caption{A system of masses connected by springs extending infinitely to 
	the left and right.}
	\label{fig:ms}
\end{figure}
Lets write the equations of motion for the $n$th mass system.
\begin{equation} \label{eqnms}
m\frac{\partial^2 u_n}{\partial t^2} = k(u_{n-1} - u_n) - k(u_n - u_{n+1}) = 
ku_{n-1} - 2ku_n + ku_{n+1} 
\end{equation}
where $u_n$ gives the displacement of the $n$th node and $k$ is the spring 
constant of each spring. To acquire, the dispersion relation for this system we 
assume a solution of the form
\begin{equation} \label{bloch}
u_n = Ae^{i(kx_n-\omega t)}
\end{equation}
$A$ is the amplitude of the wave and $x_n = nl$ where $l$ is the distance 
between the masses. Substituting the above into the equation of motion
\begin{align*}
-m \omega^2 u_n   &= ke^{i(k(n-1)l - \omega t)} - 2ku_n + ke^{i(k(n+1)l - 
\omega t)} \\
&= ke^{-ikl}u_n + ke^{ikl}u_n - 2ku_n \\
&= k\cos(kl)u_n - 2ku_n
\end{align*}
Thus,
\begin{equation}
\left[2\omega_0^2(1 - \cos(kl)) - \omega^2\right]u_n = 0
\end{equation}
where $\omega_0 = \sqrt{k/m}$ The above has a trivial solution when $u_n = 0$. 
Not so trivial solutions exist when
\begin{equation}
2\omega_0^2(1 - \cos(kl)) - \omega^2= 0
\end{equation}
We can write the dispersion relation for waves propagating through our mass 
spring system as
\begin{equation} \label{monatomicdisp}
\omega = \pm \sqrt{2\omega_0^2(1 - \cos(kl))}
\end{equation}
It is now becoming apparent that in a system of $n$ masses and springs that 
there is dispersion. To see this explicitly, write the phase velocity
\begin{equation}
v_p = \frac{w(k)}{k} = \frac{\pm\sqrt{2\omega_0^2(1 - \cos(kl))}}{k}
\end{equation}
Clearly, the phase velocity is a function of wave number/frequency which 
indicates dispersivity of the system.

Take our dispersion relation (\ref{monatomicdisp}) and nondimensionalize by 
letting $\Omega=\frac{\omega}{\omega_0}$ and $\mu=kl$. Then,
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \pm \sqrt{2(1-cos(\mu))}
\end{equation}
The positive part is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:dr}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{dispersion-rln.pdf}
	\caption{The non-dimensional dispersion relation for the mass spring system}
	\label{fig:dr}
\end{figure}
The dispersion relation characterizes many features of the mass-spring system. 
In Figure \ref{fig:dr}, it is easy to identify the phase and group velocities 
along the curve for different waves propagating through the system. 

At first glance, it appears that there are no frequencies above $\Omega = 2$. 
In this region (called the stop band), waves experience attenuation and 
exponentially die off. Wave numbers in the stop band are imaginary. Looking at 
(\ref{bloch}), it becomes obvious where the attenuation comes from. Waves whose 
wave numbers are imaginary are called \emph{evanescent} waves.

Solving for wavenumber in terms of a given frequency 
\begin{equation} 
\mu = \arccos{\left(1-\frac{\Omega^2}{2}\right)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Diatomic lattice}
Next, we consider a diatomic lattice as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dms}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{diatomic-mass-spring.pdf}
	\caption{A system of alternating masses connected by springs extending 
	infinitely to the left and right.}
	\label{fig:dms}
\end{figure}

After assuming a harmonic motion
\begin{equation}
u_n = \tilde{u}(x_n)e^{i\omega t}
\end{equation}
The equations of motion for a diatomic lattice can be written
\begin{equation}
(-\omega^2m_2 + 2k)u_{2n} - k(u_{2n-1} + u_{2n+1}) = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
(-\omega^2m_1 + 2k)u_{2n+1} - k(u_{2n} + u_{2n+2}) = 0
\end{equation}
We can write this in a matrix for
\begin{equation}
(\mathbf{K}_n - \omega^2 \mathbf{M})\mathbf{u}_n + 
\mathbf{K}_{n-1}\mathbf{u}_{n-1}
+ \mathbf{K}_{n+1}\mathbf{u}_{n+1} = 0
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}_n =
\begin{bmatrix}
u_{2n} \\
u_{2n+1}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

We will use the inverse method to solve for the dispersion relation. We use 
Bloch's theorem to write
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u_n}= \mathbf{\hat{u}}(\mu)e^{in\mu}
\end{equation}

Finally, we can write
\begin{equation}
\left[\mathbf{K}_n + \mathbf{K}_{n-1}e^{-i\mu} + \mathbf{K}_{n+1}e^{i\mu} 
-\omega^2 \mathbf{M} \right] \mathbf{\hat{u}}(\mu)e^{in\mu} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\left[\mathbf{\Bar{K}}(\mu) -\omega^2 \mathbf{M} \right] 
\mathbf{\hat{u}}(\mu)e^{in\mu} = 0
\end{equation}

Calculating the determinant of the matrix on the left we get the relation
\begin{equation}
\omega =\pm \sqrt{k\frac{m_1+m_2}{m_1m_2} \pm k 
\sqrt{\left(\frac{m_1+m_2}{m_1m_2}\right) - \frac{4(\sin{ka})^2}{m_1m_2}}}
\end{equation}

\section{Computational methods for phononic media} \label{methods}
\subsection{Plane-wave expansion method}
According to \cite{cao04}, the plane-wave method is widely used because of its 
convenience. Apparently, the drawback of the method is slow convergence.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To start expand the displacements and material properties in the wave 
	equation in terms of a Fourier series (assert solutions in the form of 
	Bloch waves)
	\item Substitute these expansions back into the wave equation
	\item After forming some kind of inner products, an eigenvalue problem can 
	be found
	\item In order to actually find the dispersion relations, one must solve 
	the eigenvalue problem for a range of wave numbers
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Finite difference method}
Finite difference methods are similar to the plane wave expansion method with 
the advantage that the solution convergence is faster for materials with 
multiple phases
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Instead of expanding the solution on material properties, the 
	differential operators of the wave equation are expanded using standard 
	finite differences
	\item The equations of motion can be written as a matrix equation
	\item An eigenvalue problem appears after asserting a Bloch wave type 
	solution
	\item Once again the eigenvalue problem must be solved for a range of wave 
	numbers
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Finite element method}
The finite element method is useful for complex material geometries. When 
applied to periodic systems, the domain of computation is greatly reduced via 
application of Bloch's theorem. The standard outline for the finite element 
method is as follows
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Formulate the weak form of the wave function by multiplying by a 
	trial function and integrating
	\item Write the equation in matrix form by allowing the solution to be 
	expressed as a combination of weight functions
	\item Apply the Bloch's theorem
	\item Solve the resulting eigenvalue problem for a range of wave numbers
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Multiple scattering method}
Compared to the above methods, the multiple scattering method has an advantage 
when the material under consideration contains scattering elements 
(resonators?). The method relies on separating the solution into fields 
associated with the incident wave and then waves scattered from each scattering 
element in the system. Once the solution, at a single scattering element a 
system of equations can be solved for the rest of the scattered fields. The 
dispersion relations are then found by application of Bloch's theorem. 

\section{Analysis of lattice structures via real time evolution}

\subsection{Monatomic lattice}
Here we verify the results of Section \ref{monatomic}. The system is modeled 
using the equations of motion (\ref{eqnms}) and the Verlet integration method. 
Figure \ref{fig:matlab-dr} displays the dispersion relation for the mass spring 
system which has been calculated from the real time evolution of the system. 
The system is excited in a range of frequencies between $\Omega=0$ and 
$\Omega=2$. For each of the frequencies, the system is allowed to evolve and 
the Fourier transform of the resulting wave is computed. In the reciprocal 
space, there is an obvious peak at one wave number. This wave number is then 
plotted with its corresponding frequency.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{matlab-dr.pdf}
	\caption{Using a Fourier transform in space, wave lengths for different 
	excitation frequencies are identified and plotted}
	\label{fig:matlab-dr}
\end{figure}

Applying a sinusoidal, forcing term to the first mass it is easy to explore the 
attenuation effect at the stop band as seen in Figure \ref{fig:dr}. Figures 
\ref{fig:snap19} and \ref{fig:snap21} display snapshots of the system at 
excitation frequencies above and below $\Omega=2$. There is an obvious drop in 
amplitude inside and outside of the stop band.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{snap-f19.pdf}
	\caption{Snapshot of mass spring system with $\Omega=1.9$}
	\label{fig:snap19}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{snap-f21.pdf}
	\caption{Snapshot of mass spring system with $\Omega=2.1$}
	\label{fig:snap21}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Diatomic lattice}
Here the results for a diatomic lattice are presented from a similar simulation 
to the above.

\end{figure}

\section{Analysis of 1D continuum materials via finite element method}
\subsection{1D uniform bar}
As a first exercise in using finite elements to find the dispersion properties 
of materials, we will solve for the real time evolution of a waves in a bar and 
find the dispersion relation in a similar manner as in the mass-spring system 
(using the Fourier transform in space). For the one dimensional problem, the 
elasticity equations we want to solve are.
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \sigma_x}{\partial x} + b_i &= \rho \frac{\partial^2 
u_x}{\partial t^2},\quad x\in[0,L]\quad\textnormal{(Equilibrium)} \\
\sigma_x &= E \varepsilon_x\quad\textnormal{(Constitutive relation)}\\
\varepsilon_x &= \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial 
x}\quad\textnormal{(Strain-displacement)}\\
u_x(x=0,t) &= A_0sin(\omega t) \\
\sigma_x(x=L,t) &= 0
\end{align}
Note that the finite element solution with $n$ nodes is analogous to the mass 
spring system with $n$ masses. Here, we can relate the material properties via 
$\rho = \frac{M}{AL}$ and $E = \frac{kL}{A}$. Thus, for a system of n masses, 
the analogous system in finite elements has material properties
\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{n}{d(n-1)}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{k_{eff}\times d(n-1)}{1}= (1/k +\cdots)^{-1} \times d(n-1)= 
\frac{d(n-1)}{n}
\end{equation}
where $L=d(n-1)$ and we require that the nodes have the spacing with respect to 
each other as the springs to with each other.

In the absence of body forces, we can find the weak form of the equilibrium 
equation by multiplying by a test function $\varphi$ and integrating of the 
domain.
\begin{equation}
\int_0^L \varphi \frac{\partial \sigma_x}{\partial x} dx
= \int_0^L \varphi \rho \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial t^2} dx
\end{equation}
Using integration by parts on the LHS of the above we find that
\begin{equation}
\varphi(L)\sigma_x(L) - \varphi(0)\sigma_x(0) 
- \int_0^1 \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x} \sigma_x dx
= \int_0^L \varphi \rho \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial t^2} dx
\end{equation}
Applying boundary conditions, constitutive relation, and the 
strain-displacement equation we arrive at the weak form of the equation
\begin{equation}
\int_0^1 \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x} E \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} 
dx
+ \int_0^L \varphi \rho \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial t^2} dx = 0
\end{equation}
Now, we approximate our test function and solution using linear shape functions
\begin{align}
\varphi &= N_i(x) \\
u_x &= \sum_j a_j(t)N_j(x)
\end{align}
Then,
\begin{equation}
\int_0^1 \frac{\partial N_i(x)}{\partial x} E \sum_j\frac{\partial 
N_j(x)}{\partial x} a_j dx
+ \int_0^L N_i \rho \sum_j N_j \frac{\partial^2 a_j(t)}{\partial t^2} dx = 0
\end{equation}
Rearranging,
\begin{equation}
\int_0^1  E \sum_j\frac{\partial N_i(x)}{\partial x}\frac{\partial 
N_j(x)}{\partial x} a_j dx
+ \int_0^L \rho \sum_j  N_i N_j \frac{\partial^2 a_j(t)}{\partial t^2} dx = 0
\end{equation}
Finally, we write the above equation in matrix form
\begin{equation} \label{matrixform}
Ka+M\ddot{a} = 0 
\end{equation}
where $K$ is called the stiffness matrix, and $M$ is called the mass matrix. 

We now assume a solution of the form
\begin{equation}
a = ae^{i(kx-\omega t)}
\end{equation}
such that the second order differential equation (\ref{matrixform}) becomes a 
complex eigenvalue problem:
\begin{equation}
Ka - \omega^2 Ma = (K-\omega^2M)a = 0
\end{equation}
Note that as of now $K$ and $M$ are not functions of the wave number and 
solving the eigenvalue problem as is does not yield any information about the 
dispersion properties of the system. To obtain this dependence the Bloch 
condition must be enforced. 

The Bloch condition is similar to the periodic boundary condition
\begin{equation}
a(x+h) = a(x)\quad\textnormal{(Periodic boundary condition)}
\end{equation}
where h is the size of the unit cell. The difference between the two conditions 
is a single multiplicative factor:
\begin{equation}
a(x+h) = e^{ik_xh}a(x)\quad\textnormal{(Bloch condition)}
\end{equation}
The multiplicative factor in the boundary condition shifts is such that when 
the wave reaches a boundary it is phase shifted to match the wave at the 
opposite boundary such that there is no interference.

Enforcing the condition is done via a linear transformation which in one 
dimension is
\begin{equation}
T = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 && \mathbf{0} \\
\mathbf{0} && \mathbf{I}\\
e^{ik_xh} && \mathbf{0}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{I}$ is an identity matrix with dimensions equal to the number of 
interior nodes (in the one dimensional case this is the total number of nodes 
minus two). Using this transformation matrix we reduce the number of degrees of 
freedoms in our system and write
\begin{equation}
a =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{left} \\
a_{int} \\
a_{right}
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 && \mathbf{0} \\
\mathbf{0} && \mathbf{I}\\
e^{ik_xh} && \mathbf{0}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{left} \\
a_{int}
\end{bmatrix}
= T \hat{a}
\end{equation}
Our eigenvalue problem is now
\begin{equation}
(K-\omega^2M)T\hat{a} = 0
\end{equation}
To make it so our matrix is square, and therefore invertible, we premultiply 
the equation by $T^T$
\begin{equation} \label{evalprob}
(\hat{K} - \omega^2 \hat{M})\hat{a} = 0
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\hat{K}(k_x) = T^T K T
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
\hat{M}(k_x) = T^T M T
\end{equation}
We are now in position to extract the dispersion properties of the uniform bar. 
The eigenvalue problem is solved several times for values of $k_x$, and we 
obtain several corresponding values for $\omega$.

I would like to thank my advisors Prof. Ponte-Casta\~neda and Prof. Reina for
guidance this semester. Additionally, I would like to thank Chenchen Liu of
Prof. Reina's group for helping me get a grip of using finite elements and Bloch
analysis for this phononic media.

\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Verlet integration}
For a single particle, the Verlet integration method is used to calculate its 
trajectory given that the forces (and therefore the acceleration) are known. 
The algorithm is
\begin{equation}
x^{t+1}_{n} = 2x^{t}_{n} - x^{t-1}_{n} + a(x^{t}_n)\Delta t^2
\end{equation}
where $t$ denotes the current time step, $x$ is the particle position, $a(x_n)$ 
is the acceleration, and $\Delta t$ is suitably small time step. b

\subsection{Finite difference in time for real time evolution FEM}
For equation (\ref{matrixform}), it is possible to apply a finite difference 
method in time in order to get the real time evolution of the uniform bar. 
First, in order to apply the displacement boundary conditions at the left 
boundary, we need to modify (\ref{matrixform}). We partition the matrices 
\begin{equation} \label{partition}
\begin{bmatrix}
K_{11} & K_{1a} \\
K_{a1} & K_{aa}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1 \\
a
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
M_{11} & M_{1a} \\
M_{a1} & M_{aa}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\ddot{a_1} \\
\ddot{a}
\end{bmatrix}
= 0
\end{equation}
Here, $K_{11}$ and $M_{11}$ denote the entry in the first row and first column. 
$K_{1a}$ and $M_{1a}$ are row vectors of the rest of the entries in the first 
row and $K_{a1}$ and $M_{a1}$ are column vectors of the remaining elements of 
the first column. $K_{aa}$ and $M_{aa}$ are then matrices of the remaining 
elements of the matrices $K$ and $M$. Since we know $a_1$ and $\ddot{a_1}$ 
(these are the displacement and acceleration at the first node), we only wish 
to solve the bottom row of ($\ref{partition}$).
\begin{equation}
K_{aa}a + M_{aa}\ddot{a} = -a_1K_{a1} - \ddot{a_1}M_{a1}
\end{equation}

To solve the above we discretize $\ddot{a}$ in time using an explicit finite 
difference scheme.
\begin{equation}
K_{aa}a^t + M_{aa}\frac{a^{t+1} - 2a^t + a^{t-1}}{\Delta t^2 } = 
-a_1^{t+1}K_{a1} - \ddot{a_1}^{t+1}M_{a1}
\end{equation}
Solving for $a^{t+1}$
\begin{equation}
a^{t+1} = M_{aa}^{-1}(-a_1^{t+1}K_{a1} - \ddot{a_1}^{t+1}M_{a1} - 
K_{aa}a^t)\Delta t^2 
+ 2a^t - a^{t-1}
\end{equation}
